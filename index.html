  <h1>Hi, my name is Zack.</h1>
  <p>I am the owner and only employee of Cryptek Gamez. I make tons of games and here are 10 of the most presentable ones.</p>
  <p>Just as a side note I am currently 10 and I built these games whenever I was 9 and 10. I started spending a lot of time coding and recently I've been having this kind of dilemma, where I've wanted to actually make something that I can show the world instead of having them on my little server in my computer.</p>
  <p>So I want to use your program so that I can make a game or project that I can share to the world. I hope you love my Gamez and please give me some feedback Now without further ado let's play some games!</p>

    <h2>4. Mantha Grab</h2>
    <p>Our next game is called Mantha Grab. It's a really funny game about when I was on the couch one night I saw my dad playing with my little sister with an army man and he was trying to get it away from her. She was still with that face where she puts everything in her mouth so he was trying to not let her get it. And I saw it and I was like I should make kind of like a Whack a mole game out of this but reverse where you're the army man. So here's my game a really hilarious Whack a mole game where you're the mole.</p>

    <h2>5. WOPR</h2>
    <p>This next game or coding project is called WOPR. It's inspired off of a movie called war games where they have the WOPR Or War, operation, Planned, response. And the specific scene I'm thinking of Is Whenever it's trying to guess the nuclear codes and launch them. And you just see so many numbers that are flying around so fast it's really really cool so I decided to recreate that in this coding project.</p>
